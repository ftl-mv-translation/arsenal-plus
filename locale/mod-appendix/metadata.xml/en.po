"Arsenal+ is a Cyrillic FTL mod that combines assets from other total conversion mods such as Captain's Edition and Insurrection, along with weapons from various other mods, with a plethora of original content mixed in to expand the game, bringing in a whole new FTL experience.\n"
"\n"
"The events, although probably inspired by other mods, are all original to this mod. Furthermore, though this mod uses assets from other mods for the initial creation of weapons, drones, etc., but the ending balance and characteristics of these assets are specific to this mod.\n"
"\n"
"Adds weapons, drones, etc. assets from the FTL: Captain's Edition mod, found here: https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=15663, improves graphics and much more. Not all the graphics assets(sprites, weapon art, etc.) were created by the makers of this mod: some assets from different mods from the official game forum are incorporated into this mod.\n"
"\n"
"Captain's Edition's assets are correctly given credit; this can be found on this mod's official forum page."
