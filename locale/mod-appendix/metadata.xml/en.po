"Arsenal+ is a Cyrillic FTL mod that combines assets from other total "
"conversion mods such as Captain's Edition and Insurrection, along with "
"weapons from various other mods, with a plethora of original content mixed "
"in to expand the game, bringing in a whole new FTL experience.\n"
"\n"
"The events, although probably inspired by other mods, are all original to "
"this mod. Furthermore, though this mod uses assets from other mods for the "
"initial creation of weapons, drones, etc., but the ending balance and "
"characteristics of these assets are specific to this mod.\n"
"\n"
"Adds weapons, drones, etc. assets from the FTL: Captain's Edition mod, found "
"here: https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=15663, improves "
"graphics and much more. Not all the graphics assets(sprites, weapon art, "
"etc.) were created by the makers of this mod: some assets from different "
"mods from the official game forum are incorporated into this mod.\n"
"\n"
"Captain's Edition's assets are correctly given credit; this can be found on "
"this mod's official forum page."
